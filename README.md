# esphome_rgb_led_remote
ESPHome Configuration YAML for generic RGB LED Remotes as shown below, that come with mostly all the cheap noname RGB LED Stripes or other RGB LED lights.  
Surprisingly I couldn't find a working example for these online, so I thought sharing mine might be helpful to somebody.

The Configuration is for an esp based LED Strip with an IR Receiver. Feel free to just copy the remote codes.
